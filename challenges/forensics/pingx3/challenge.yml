  We managed to get a forensics dump of a cybercriminal's laptop. We know they used Discord for communications, but we can't find a trace of Discord on their laptop! What we know is they definitely had notifications enabled...
  You can find the disk here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jOCRGVq6oargfHBGuPodD4DtN7vWG1os/view?usp=sharing
