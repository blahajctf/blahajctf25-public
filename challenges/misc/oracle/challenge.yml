description: This is a blockchain treasury protocol and an associated price oracle. Since blockchain challenges are too difficult, we've simulated it in Python instead! Drain the treasury to claim the flag. (`sample.py` is an example script to allow you to interact with the "blockchain", `server.py` is the source code for the simulation.)

flags:
  - blahaj{flash_loaning_out_the_bank}
